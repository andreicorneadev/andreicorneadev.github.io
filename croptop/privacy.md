# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how CropTop (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles data in connection with your use of the CropTop Discord bot (the “Bot”).

## 1. Information We Collect

CropTop may collect the following data:
- User IDs and server (guild) IDs for configuration and moderation purposes
- Message content only when required for a feature (e.g., commands or logs) and only in ephemeral memory unless logging is explicitly enabled
- Usage statistics (e.g., command usage counts) for improving functionality

CropTop does **not** collect or store:
- Personal identifiable information (PII) such as email addresses, passwords, or IP addresses
- Direct messages (DMs)

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected data only to:
- Provide and improve the Bot’s features
- Ensure functionality such as moderation tools, server settings, or command tracking
- Prevent abuse and maintain security

## 3. Data Storage

- Any data that is stored (such as server-specific settings) is kept in secure storage and is not shared with third parties.
- Data is retained only as long as necessary to operate the Bot.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or share your data with third parties. Data may be shared only if required by law or to enforce our Terms of Service.

## 5. Your Rights

You may request the removal of server-specific data (if applicable) by contacting us via Discord or GitHub. Server administrators can also use built-in commands (if provided) to reset stored settings.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

CropTop is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. By using the Bot, you affirm that you are at least 13 years old or have guardian consent.
